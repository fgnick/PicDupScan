# PicDupScan (v2.0)

## About

PicDupScan was born out of a personal need.

As a photography enthusiast, I often found myself accumulating large numbers of
duplicate and near-duplicate photos. Many existing solutions are commercial
products with extensive feature sets, much of which I did not need for my
workflow. Rather than paying for a tool that felt overly complex, I built
PicDupScan to focus on the core problem in a more controlled and transparent way.

PicDupScan is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool developed with Python and PyQt6, designed to help users scan and find duplicate or highly similar images within specified folders. It supports common image formats as well as RAW files, and provides intuitive preview and management functions, making the process of cleaning up your image library much easier.


## Branch Strategy

- **main**: v2 (current development)
- **v1**: legacy v1 codebase (maintenance only)


## ✨ Features

I am working on it... = = b, and I will update the README.md file as soon as I have something to show or a new function to add.

## 🛠️ Requirements

This project was developed and tested in a **Windows** environment using **Python 3**.
You can use pyinstaller to package the application into an executable file on you OS.

### Core Language
* Python 3.8 or higher

### Dependencies

So far is similar to v1, but I will add more features in the future.
